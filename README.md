# DineFlow: Premium Restaurant SaaS (Multi-Tenant)

- **Floating Bottom Bar**: Real-time order summary (items & total) with a "View Order" quick-access button.
- **Visual Table Management**: Color-coded table statuses (Available, Taken, Pending).

### 3. Kitchen Dashboard
- **Real-Time Sync**: Instant order notifications from waiters.
- **Order Tracking**: Transitions from "Pending" to "Preparing" and "Ready" with a single tap.
